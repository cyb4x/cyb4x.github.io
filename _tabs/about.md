# 👨‍💻 Said Hussein (cyb4x)

Hey! I'm **Said Hussein**, also known as **cyb4x** — a passionate Red Teamer and cybersecurity trainer with a strong background in offensive security, system exploitation, and CTFs. I spend my time hunting for vulnerabilities, building pentesting labs, mentoring students, and automating complex recon and exploitation workflows.

## 🛡️ What I Do

- **Red Teaming & Pentesting**  
  Specialized in simulating adversarial attacks, including network exploitation, web app abuse, Active Directory (AD) compromise, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.

- **Cybersecurity Field Training**  
  I design practical, real-world scenarios to train future Red Teamers, helping them master topics like FTP exploitation, CMS abuse, RCE, and AD enumeration.

- **Dev Work for CTF Platforms & Lab Infra**  
  Skilled in Laravel, Python, and Bash — I create custom tools, scripts, and modules for user management, fingerprint recognition, automated wordlist generation, and more.

---

## 🧰 Tools I Often Use

- `evil-winrm`, `netexec`, `secretsdump`, `BloodHound`, `Nmap`, `Burp Suite`, `Impacket`, and custom scripts for enumeration and attack automation.
- I frequently build workflows using `robocopy`, `reg.exe`, `diskshadow`, and other native Windows tools for stealthy extraction of NTDS.dit, SYSTEM hives, and more.

## 📂 Current Projects

- Building a **University Management System** in Laravel, with advanced modules for examination logistics, venue allocation, student biometrics, and feedback management.
- Developing **automated brute-force and registration bots** with multithreaded Python scripts, CSRF handling, and real-time progress indicators.
- Conducting **Active Directory forensics** and database breach simulations in controlled training environments.

## 🎯 Philosophy

> *“Train like it’s real, hack like it’s war.”*

I believe in combining deep technical expertise with practical exposure. Whether it’s a VulnLab machine, HackTheBox challenge, or an internal red team engagement, I aim to learn and teach through real-world simulations that sharpen both the mind and hands.
